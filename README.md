Data analyse.

Student grade prediction according to his type of school (public - non-public), his grades before the final test, his type of teaching, the number of people in his class ...

there is no gender correlation.

we tried linear regression (always the simplest model) then tried adding ridge and lasso (in order to improve the variance) but also an svr and a random forest.

It seems that the linear regression gives good result (coupled to ridge)
